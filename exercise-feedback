Exercise 1
// How would you change this code to make the value of the quanitity variable dynamic?
You wrote:
userInput = prompt("Enter an amount");
let dq = parseFloat(userInput);
console.log(dq);

How would you update this so that the variable, quantity, has the value of the user's response to the prompt?

Exercise 2-4 - Great job!!

Exercise 5
Remember to define your variable values. You do not have a let or const before creating the variable.

Exercise 6
Please complete the exercise. Remember, you have to convert the strings into numbers before you can add them.

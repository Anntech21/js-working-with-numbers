/********************** Exercise 1  **********************/
// Describe the following code:

let wholesalePrice = 5.45;

let retailPrice = 9.99;
console.log(retailPrice);
let quantity = 47;
console.log(quantity);
let salesTotal = retailPrice * quantity;

let profit = salesTotal - (wholesalePrice * quantity);
console.log(profit);

//its quantifing the profit

// Where might this code be used?
//This code might be used to build a POS system for retail companies, frontend backend interface.

// Run this code and log the profit variable in the console. What answer do you get? 
console.log("$" + profit);
//213.38;

// How would you change this code to make the value of the quantity variable dynamic?

// Step 1: Calculate the sum of two numbers and log the result.

// Step 3: Calculate the product of two numbers and print the result.

// Step 4: Calculate the result of dividing two numbers and print the result. Handle division by zero.

/********************** Exercise 3 - Decades Calculator **********************/
// Store your current age into a variable.
// Store a maximum age into a variable (10 years older than you are now).
// Store an estimated number of meals you should eat per day (as a number).

/********************** Exercise 5 - Weather Converter **********************/
// Write a calculation that converts celsius to fahrenheit. To get the value of fahrenheit, you have to multiply the celsius value by 9/5 and then add 32.

// Log the above variables in the console. What is the output?

// Without changing the below code, how could you write some new code between the variable declarations and the log, so that the answer is logged to the console? Use JavaScript number tools, please—don't reassign a number directly, as in: `wordVersion = 4`.

let numVersion = 4;
let wordVersion = "four";

let value = numVersion / wordVersion;

//value printed out as NaN

console.log("Four divided by four is: " + numVersion / wordVersion);

// Look up the isNaN() operator in MDN. What does it do? How would you use it?

//The output displayed is false

let testVariable2 = "hello";
